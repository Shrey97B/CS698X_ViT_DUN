# DUN Based Vision Transformers 

The given repository contains the files and details of the project entitled "DUN based Vision Transformer", performed over the course CS698X (guided by Prof. Piyush Rai - IIT Kanpur). The project focuses on the area of probabilistic modelling and inference and is largely based on the following two papers:

[[1] Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit, and Neil Houlsby. An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale, 2020.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)

[[2]Javier Antor´an, James Urquhart Allingham, and Jos´e Miguel Hern´andez-Lobato. Depth uncertainty in neural networks, 2020.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08437)

In the project, we explore the performance of depth uncertainty networks over different datasets mentioned in the paper and an additional dataset. Further, we explore the possibility of applying the base idea over Vision Transformers. Please go through the file `ViT_DUN_Report.pdf` for more details.
